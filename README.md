# CRYPTOCURRENCY DASHBOARDS
CRYPTOCURRENCY DASHBOARDS

Project Overview:

This project is a dynamic web application that tracks and displays live market data for over 200 cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Solana, etc. It fetches real-time pricing, volume, market cap, and trend charts from a crypto API and presents the data in an interactive dashboard for users, traders, analysts, or investors.
It is created to help people visualize the crypto market at a glance, monitor trends, and make informed decisions.

 How the Project Works (Step-by-Step):

1. Frontend (User Interface):
The UI shows:

Real-time price ticker for top coins

Search/filter bar to explore 200+ coins

Interactive charts (candlestick/line)

Market cap rankings

Volume, price % change (24h, 7d)

Built with:

HTML, CSS, JavaScript

React.js (for dynamic rendering)

Chart.js / Recharts (for interactive graphs)

2. Backend/API Integration:
No need for a custom backend in many cases. The dashboard calls public cryptocurrency APIs to fetch live data.

Most used APIs:

CoinGecko API (Free & powerful)

CoinMarketCap API (needs API key)

Binance API (for trading data)

Data fetched includes:

Price in USD/INR

Volume

Market cap

% change over time

Time-series historical data

3. Real-Time Updates:
Uses setInterval() in JavaScript or WebSockets (optional) to refresh data every few seconds/minutes.

Graphs automatically re-render when new data is fetched.

4. Data Visualization:
Uses libraries like:

Chart.js, Recharts, or Highcharts to show:

Line chart for price history

Bar charts for market cap

Pie chart for top 10 holdings (optional)

5. Responsive Design:
Built to work on desktop, tablet, and mobile using Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS.
